## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

Welcome to the GTA VI interactive website project. This modern, scroll-driven experience is packed with advanced animations that bring the world of GTA VI to life. Follow the journey of Lucia Caminos and Jason Duval through the vibrant and dangerous world of Leonida.

The website features dynamic SplitText reveals, smooth parallax scrolling, and scroll-triggered effects using GSAP's ScrollTrigger. Sections are locked in place with pinned animations, video playback is synced to scroll position for cinematic storytelling, and visual impact is enhanced with scroll-based image masking. The fully responsive UI adapts beautifully across all screen sizes, ensuring an immersive experience for all users.
